 * Random Graph Generation. Write subroutines that generate two kinds of “random” undirected graphs of 5000 vertices.
 * • In the first graph G1, the average vertex degree is 6;
 * • In the second graph G2, each vertex is adjacent to about 20% of the other vertices, which are randomly chosen;
 * • Randomly assign positive weights to edges in the graphs.
 * Your graphs should be ”random” enough. Therefore, in the graph G1, the pairs of vertices that are adjacent 
 *   should be chosen randomly. 
 * And in the graph G2, the number of neighbors and the neighbors of a vertex should be chosen randomly. 
 * To make sure that your graphs are connected, you should start with a cycle that contains 
 *   all vertices of the graphs, then add the rest edges randomly.
